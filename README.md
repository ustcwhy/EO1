## Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for General Robot Control
> We sincerely apologize for the delay in releasing the data and model weights. As we’ve been focused on the paper DDL, progress has been slightly delayed. The optimized dataset and model release will follow right after—thank you for your patience.

We introduce **EO-1** model, an open-source unified embodied foundation model comprising 3B parameters, trained on the carefully curated interleaved embodied dataset EO-Data1.5M, Web Multimodal Data, and Robot Control Data (AgiBotWorld, Open X-Embodiment, RoboMIND, SO100-Community, etc.). The **EO-1** model adopt a single unified decoder-only transformer that integrates discrete auto-regressive decoding with continuous flow matching denoising for multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control, enabling seamless perception, planning, reasoning, and acting in single model. This work highlights the following features:

- ⚡ **Unified Architecture**: A single decoder-only transformer integrating text, image, video, and actions.
- 📚 **EO-1.5M Dataset**: 1.5M high-quality interleaved samples (Physical, Reasoning, Spatial, Control).
- 🌀 **Interleaved Pretraining**: Seamless synergy between language and action with autoregressive + flow matching.
- 🤖 **Reasoning-Enhanced Generalization**: Superior generalization capabilities with multimodal embodied reasoning and real robot control.

### Inference with pre-trained model

**EO-1** is built entirely on 🤗 HuggingFace Transformers and Lerobot, making deployment straightforward and accessible. If your environment supports transformers and lerobot, you can load the model and run inference directly with just a few lines of code (requires ~6.5GB GPU memory). **EO-1** unifies high-level embodied reasoning with low-level robot control, producing either natural language outputs or actionable robot commands.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor

# load model and processor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("IPEC-COMMUNITY/EO-1-3B", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
  "IPEC-COMMUNITY/EO-1-3B",
  trust_remote_code=True,
  dtype=torch.bfloat16
).eval().cuda()

# prepare the model input
batch = {
    "observation.images.image": [img],
    "observation.images.wrist_image": [wrist_img],
    "observation.state": [state],
    "task": ["Pick up a red piece and place it at (0, 2)."]
}

# 1. action sampling [robot control]
output = processor.select_action(model, batch)
print(output.action)

# prepare conversation
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": "demo_data/example2.png"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "You are a helpful physical agent equipped with both reasoning and robotic control. \
            You see the Tic-Tac-Toe board, think strategically, act logically, and block threats."},
        ],
    },
]

# 2. text generation [multimodal reasoning]
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
  messages,
  tokenize=True,
  return_dict=True,
  return_tensors="pt"
).to("cuda")
input_length = inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]

outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=1024, return_dict_in_generate=True)
generated_ids = outputs.sequences
text = processor.decode(generated_ids[0, input_length:])
print(text)
```

### Datasets

We use [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) as the primary source for robot control training and evaluation, with [Any4LeRobot](https://github.com/Tavish9/any4lerobot) providing convenient data conversion and preprocessing utilities.
For Multimodal data, e.g., image, video, text, points and bounding boxes, we follow the [Qwen2.5-VL](https://colab.research.google.com/github/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/spatial_understanding.ipynb) and [Qwen2-VL-Finetune](https://github.com/2U1/Qwen2-VL-Finetune) recipes. In interleaved pretraining, we integrate the EO-Data1.5M dataset — a large-scale, high-quality embodied dataset designed to unify reasoning and control. Data are organized in a standardized format as shown below:

<p align="left"> <img src=".assets/data_example.png" width="100%"> </p>
Here, the `lerobot` and `view` fields connect actions with multimodal conversations, enabling the model to capture the rich temporal dynamics and causal dependencies among vision, language, and action modalities — a core requirement for robust performance in open-world embodied interactions. For more details, please refer to [getting_started/1_load_dataset](getting_started/1_load_dataset.ipynb).

To combine robot control data and multimodal data, we support a [flexible YAML-based configuration](eo/data/schema.py), where each dataset can be assigned weights and sampling strategies. This makes it easy to balance embodied control trajectories with multimodal reasoning data for interleaved training. For example:

```yaml
# @multimodal data config
mm_datasets:
  # classical multimodal data
  - json_path: demo_data/refcoco/refcoco.jsonl # jsonl file
    vision_base_path: demo_data/refcoco # base path for vision data files referenced in the JSONL
    sampling_strategy: random:100% # sampling strategy

  # interleaved data jsonl, rely on `lerobot_datasets` to load robot control data
  - json_path: demo_data/interleaved_demo.jsonl

# @robot control config
lerobot_datasets:
  - repo_id: demo25
    root: ./demo_data
    # Optional fields:
    episodes: [1, 2, 3] # specific episodes to load (None = all)
    train_subtask: mix:0.9 # mix sub-task instructions and overall instructions with 90% sub-task
    delta_action: false # train with delta actions
    state_mode: "MEAN_STD" # state normalization mode
    select_video_keys: # which camera streams to load
      [
        observation.images.head,
        observation.images.hand_left,
        observation.images.hand_right,
      ]
    select_state_keys: # proprioceptive states
      [observation.states.joint.position, observation.states.effector.position]
    select_action_keys: # action targets
      [actions.joint.position, actions.effector.position]
    effector_indices: [14, 15] # indices of effector channels in the flattened action vector
    weight: 1.0 # dataset weight for sampling
```

### 2. Fine-tuning on your dataset

**EO-1**, Mastering Diverse Manipulations on Multiple Embodiments, demonstrates its robustness and adaptability by performing a wide range of dexterous manipulation tasks across heterogeneous robotic platforms. We evaluate its performance on both short-horizon and long-horizon tasks, spanning Franka Panda, WidowX 250 S, AgiBot G-1, and LeRobot SO100.

<p align="left">
  <img src=".assets/merged_grid.gif" width="100%">
</p>

To fine-tune **EO-1** on your own embodiment, you only need to adapt the configuration file. Specifically, convert your dataset into the LeRobot format, then define the fields that describe where your videos, states, and actions are located. The following YAML snippet shows a typical setup:

```yaml
# @multimodal data config
# leave empty if only robot control data
mm_datasets:

lerobot_datasets:
  - repo_id: libero_spatial_no_noops_1.0.0_lerobot # replace with your dataset name
    root: ./demo_data/ # replace with your dataset root path
    select_video_keys: [
        observation.images.image,
        observation.images.wrist_image,
      ] # replace with your feature keys
    select_state_keys: [observation.state]
    select_action_keys: [action]

  - repo_id: libero_90_no_noops_lerobot
    root: HF_LEROBOT_HOME
    # If not specified, uses all keys by default
```

Once your dataset is prepared and the configuration file (e.g., example.yaml) is set up, you can launch fine-tuning with the following command. We use torchrun to support distributed or multi-GPU training, while the arguments control training mode, optimization, and which model components to freeze or update. Please launch scripts to [experiments/1_demo](experiments/1_demo) and [experiments/2_libero](experiments/2_libero)to start a demo training.

```bash
accelerate launch $ACCELERATE_ARGS scripts/train.py \
    ${model_name_or_path:+--model-name-or-path $model_name_or_path} \
    ${deepspeed:+--deepspeed configs/${deepspeed}.json} \
